/*
 * Some terminology: SETTING a bit means that if K-th bit is 0, then set it to 1
 * and if it is 1 then leave it unchanged (in other words, a bit is SET if it is
 * 1)
 *
 * CLEARING a bit means that if K-th bit is 1, then clear it to 0 and if it is 0
 * then leave it unchanged (a bit is CLEAR if it is 0)
 *
 * COMPLEMENTING or TOGGLING a bit means that if K-th bit is 1, then change it
 * to 0 and if it is 0 then change it to 1.

/* Part 1.1 Write the function long mangle(long SID) which will take your sudent
 * ID and alter it in ways that depend on the binary representation of it as an
 * integer.
 *
 * Specifications: 
 *     1) right shift the ID by 2 positions 
 *     2) clear bit 6 (counting from the LSB=0) 
 *     3) complement bit 3 (If bit 3 is one, make it 0, If bit 3 is 0, make it 
 *        1)

 *   OUTPUT EXAMPLE:
 *   Part 2.1: Enter your UW Student ID number: 
 *    You entered 51218 
 *    Your mangled SID is 12812

/* Part 1.2  More bit manipulation. The function bit_check(int data, int bits_on,
 * int bits_off), will check an int to see if a specific mask of  bits is set
 * AND that another bit mask is clear.  Returns 1 if matches and 0 if not.
 * Return -1 for the degenerate case of testing for BOTH off and on for any bit
 *
 * Pseudocode examples of some masks and what they are checking  (Using 4-bit
 * #'s for clarity)
 *
 * bits_on = binary(0011) - this mask means that we are checking if the last
 *                          two LSBs (e.g. 00XX, the X bits) of the data are
 *                          SET (1). bits_off= binary(0100) - this mask means
 *                          that we are checking if the third LSB (e.g. 0X00,
 *                          the X bit) of the data is CLEAR (0).
 *
 * Example of returning -1: bits_on = binary(0110) bits_off= binary(0011) here
 * the second LSB (00X0, the X bit) has to be both SET and CLEAR to pass
 * according to the masks, which is impossible - in this case we return a -1
 * for invalid mask combinations.
 *
 * Again in pseudocode, some examples of actual checks/values that the test
 * code would do: (Using 4-bit #'s for clarity)
 *
 *  int d = binary(1100)  // pseudocode 
 *  int onmask1 =  binary(0011)  
 *  int offmask1 = binary(0100)  
 *  int onmask2 =  binary(0100)
 *  int offmask2 = binary(0001)  
 *
 *  bit_check(d, onmask1, offmask1) --> 0 
 *  bit_check(d, onmask1, offmask2) --> -1 // contradictory
 *  bit_check(d, onmask2, offmask2) --> 1 
 *  bit_check(d, offmask1, offmask1) --> -1 // contradictory

/*******************************************************************************
   Part 3: Working with structs
*******************************************************************************/

/* Part 3.1: Define a struct in "c_prog2.h" to represent a custom datatype

 * contain the following:
 *     1) a max 20 char string: FirstName
 *     2) a max 30 char string: LastName
 *     3) a max 80 char string: StreetAddr
 *     4) a max 6 char string: ZipCode

 *     5) double: Height      // height in meters
 *     6) float: Weight       // weight in kg
 *     7) long int: DBirth    // birthday (days since 1-Jan-1900)
 *
 * NOTE: The existing declaration shows the general syntax of creating a
 * struct but is just a placeholder with the correct fields so the code
 * will compile and the tests will run.
 */

/* Part 3.2: Write a function personSize that returns the number of bytes
 * required to store the person struct in memory. What do you think the number
 * will be?
 * 
 * HINT: You can use built in library functions for this.
 *
 * NOTE: This should be the same for everyone on the Arduino Mega, but 
 * if you compile for a different chip the size may vary. Look up 
 * 'structure padding in C' to see why. For example, the computer processes 
 * data in the minimum of 4 or 8 bytes for 32/64 bit processors.

 * formatted person. If the person's address is longer than 60 characters,
 * truncate it to 60 characters but do not erase memory of the last 20
 * characters if present.
 * 
 * HINT: You can use functions from the standard string libraries. For example,
 * the sprintf function can help create formatted strings with a mix of words
 * and numbers (see the testing code in c_prog2_arduino.ino for examples). The
 * function strcat can also be useful for concatenating strings together.
 * 
 * Also some microcontrollers do not have hardware support for floating point 
 * operations. You'll notice that Arduino does not support certain standard c
 * functions like the ability to use %f to print floating point numbers with
 * sprintf. Define the helper function floats_to_ints(float f, int* output) that
 * takes in a floating point number and converts it to 2 integers in the int
 * array output. You may find built in math functions such as round helpful.
